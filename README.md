# Robin's dr4ft fork

This is a fork of [dr4ft](https://github.com/dr4fters/dr4ft) that I've played around with. I've implemented a setting for one rare per pack in cube drafts on branch `rare-per-pack-upshifting` and custom pack slots and card categories in cube drafts on branch `asfan-groupings`. I just did the minimum to get these features working for my own playgroup, and quite a bit work would be needed to productionalize it. Minimum additional work would include adding pre-draft checks that valid packs can be formed (e.g. there are enough rares in the cube to put one in each pack) and adding tests for the new functionality.
